# Hasura CLI

## Installation

You can download the CLI from the images below and start using it immediately. Please download the correct binary for
your system:

- For [Intel Macs](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/ddn/cli/v2023.08.10-internal/hasura3_x86_64-apple-darwin):
  `hasura3_x86_64-apple-darwin`
- For [M1 Macs](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/ddn/cli/v2023.08.10-internal/hasura3_aarch64-apple-darwin):
  `hasura3_aarch64-apple-darwin`
- For [Linux](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/ddn/cli/v2023.08.10-internal/hasura3_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl):
  `hasura3_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`

### Install instructions for Linux/Macs:

1. Download the correct binary ☝️
2. Rename the binary to `hasura3`
3. Run `chmod +x hasura3` (This makes the binary executable on your system)
4. (For MacOS Only): Right click on the hasura3 binary (or, two finger tap if you are using a trackpad), and click on
   `open` in the popup menu. You will get a warning saying that macOS cannot verify the author of the binary, and asking
   you whether you want to still open the binary or not. Click on `open`. A terminal window should open, with the
   commands of Hasura3 CLI printed. Close the terminal window.
5. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/` (run `mv hasura3 /usr/local/bin/`). Please ensure that `/usr/local/bin/` is in
   your PATH

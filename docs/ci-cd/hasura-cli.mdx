# Hasura CLI

## Installation

You can [download the CLI from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hasura/v3-cli/releases) and start using it. Please
download the correct binary for your system:

- For Intel Macs: `hasura3_x86_64-apple-darwin`
- For M1 Macs: `hasura3_aarch64-apple-darwin`
- For Linux: `hasura3_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- For Windows: `hasura3_x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe`

### Install instructions for Linux/Macs:

1. Download the correct binary from GitHub Releases ([link](https://github.com/hasura/v3-cli/releases))
2. Rename the binary to `hasura3`
3. Run `chmod +x hasura3` (This makes the binary executable on your system)
4. (For MacOS Only): Right click on the hasura3 binary (or, two finger tap if you are using a trackpad), and click on
   `open` in the popup menu. You will get a warning saying that macOS cannot verify the author of the binary, and asking
   you whether you want to still open the binary or not. Click on `open`. A terminal window should open, with the
   commands of Hasura3 CLI printed. Close the terminal window.
5. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/` (run `mv hasura3 /usr/local/bin/`). Please ensure that `/usr/local/bin/` is in
   your PATH

### Install instructions for Windows:

1. Download `hasura3_x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe` from GitHub Releases and run it

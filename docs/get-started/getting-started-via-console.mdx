# Getting Started with Hasura

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new project on the Hasura Console, connect a cloud-hosted
database, execute your first query, and create lightning-fast production builds. Throughout this guide, you'll be
introduced to new Hasura concepts, like Builds, our new Metadata structure, and more.

## Introduction

This guide will focus on a Console-first workflow. **You'll need a cloud-hosted database.** If you're interested in
using a local database, check out our guide on
[getting started from the CLI and a local database using Secure Connect](/get-started/getting-started-via-cli.mdx).

## Step 1: Log into the Hasura Console

Go to the [Hasura Console](https://console.hasura.io) and sign into your account:

## Step 2: Create a new project

Click on the `Create ->` button to create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-create-project.png" alt="Create new project" width="1000px" />

Upon your project's successful creation, you'll be brought to its GraphiQL Explorer. You'll notice that there are no
types available in your GraphQL API. That will soon change!

## Step 3: Connect a data source

Head to your project's Metadata by clicking on the `Metadata` tab on the left. We'll begin by connecting to a data
source via the `+ Connect` button:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-connect-data-source.png"
  alt="Click to connect data source"
  width="1000px"
/>

Enter a name for your data source, and select the `Postgres` option. At the bottom of the modal, enter your connection
string and then click `Connect`:

:::info All those tables!

If your database has tables present, Hasura automatically detected all of them and added them to your project's Metadata
ðŸŽ‰

:::

## Step 4: Import Models

Now that we've connected to a data source, we can import **Models** from it to our Metadata. Click on the `+ Import`
button next to `Models` to begin:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-add-models.png" alt="Click + Import for Models" width="1000px" />

We'll then choose our data source, check the box for all of the tables we want to import, and click `Import`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-check-all-import.png" alt="Add Models" width="1000px" />

:::info What are Models?

This is the first new concept we've introduced in this guide. Models are a new way to represent your data in Hasura.

Models in DDS refer to a collection of objects (such as rows in a relational database, or documents in a NoSQL database)
of a given DDS type. Models are backed by a data source and can support CRUD operations. You can learn more about Models
[here](/api-schema/models.mdx).

:::

While we're here, check out the `Relationships` section of your Metadata file. Hasura automatically detected the
relationships between your tables and added them to your project's Metadata, too:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-show-relationships.png"
  alt="Show relationships in metadata view"
  width="1000px"
/>

You can even keep scrolling and see the newly-generated `Types` and `GraphQL Interface` sections of your Metadata file.

## Step 5: Create a new Build

Now that we've connected to a data source and imported our Models, we're ready to create a new **Build**. Click on the
`+ Create New Build` button in the top-right corner of the Console:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_create-new-build.png" alt="Create a new build" width="1000px" />

:::info What's a Build?

Builds are incremental snapshots of your project's Metadata. They're a new concept in Hasura that allow you to quickly
iterate and prototype on your project's Metadata.

:::

## Step 6: Run your first query

Assuming you have some tables and data in your database, you can now run your first query! Click on the `GraphiQL`
button in the left-hand sidenav of the Console.

We're using the docs sample app's schema for this guide's visuals, but you can use the Explorer to create your query or
write it manually:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-execute-query-on-build.png" alt="Execute a query" width="1000px" />

## Step 7: Apply your Build

After you're satisfied your API is behaving as expected, click the `build_id` in the bottom navigation bar. This will
bring up all your project's Builds and allow you to choose one to apply. Click the `Apply` button to apply your Build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.0.1_console-apply-build.png" alt="Apply a build" width="1000px" />

:::info What does it mean to apply a Build?

Applying a Build means that it's being promoted to your project's production environment. **This is a new concept in
Hasura which allows you to quickly iterate â€” and, if needed, roll back â€” your project's Metadata to all of your users,
worldwide.**

:::

## Step 8: Toggle your production endpoint

At the top of the Console, you'll see a toggle that allows you to switch between your project's applied Build and your
project's currently selected Build. Toggle to your project's applied Build:

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/0.1.1_console-view-project-graphiql.png" alt="Toggle production" width="1000px" />

## What's next?

### Iterate on your Metadata

We've just demonstrated how to quickly get set up and running with Hasura. Now that you've got a project up and running,
you can iterate on your Metadata and build out your API. Head back to the Metadata tab, make some modifications, create
a new Build, and see what happens ðŸŽ‰

### Check out the CLI

The Hasura Console is a great way to get started with Hasura, but it's not the only way. Check out our guide on
[getting started from the CLI and a local database using Secure Connect](/get-started/getting-started-via-cli.mdx) to
learn more.

# Component Testing

<CodeStep
  language={`javascript`}
  code={`console.log("Hey, this works 🤙");`}
  output={`Hey, this works 🤙`}
>

## Add a component

This is just to see what happens 😘

</CodeStep>

<CodeStep
  language={`python`}
  code={`print("Click me!")`}
  output={`Click me!`}
>

## Add another for good measure

Let's also make sure `code` works like in the `v2` PR. And even a `<CodeStep />` component 🤷‍♂️

Brilliant ☝️ — final check is a link to [the homepage](/).

</CodeStep>

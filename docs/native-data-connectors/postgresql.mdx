# Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL

The Native Data Connector for PostgreSQL is our flagship connector, with rich support for all kinds of queries.

## Scalar types

SQL data types are mapped to GraphQL types. The current mappings are as follows:

| SQL data type                   | GraphQL type |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `boolean`                       | `Boolean`    |
| `smallint`                      | `Int`        |
| `integer`                       | `Int`        |
| `bigint`                        | `Int`        |
| `smallserial`                   | `Int`        |
| `serial`                        | `Int`        |
| `bigserial`                     | `Int`        |
| `decimal`                       | `Float`      |
| `numeric`                       | `Float`      |
| `real`                          | `Float`      |
| `double precision`              | `Float`      |
| `text`                          | `String`     |
| `character varying` (`varchar`) | `String`     |

Other SQL scalar types are unsupported, but may still work in certain situations.

:::info Data type aliases

Note that many of these SQL data types have aliases in PostgreSQL, which can be found in the [PostgreSQL documentation
on data types][PostgreSQL: data types].

## Nested types

The connector does not currently support nested data structures, such as `array`, `hstore`, `json`, or `jsonb`, though
they may still work in certain situations.

## Queries

The connector supports all query operations; see the general documentation for details.

### Predicates

The `_is_null` operator checks whether a value is `NULL`.

The following binary operators are supported when filtering:

| Name                       | GraphQL operator | PostgreSQL operator | GraphQL types |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| equals                     | `_eq`            | `=`                 | all           |
| not equals                 | `_neq`           | `<>`                | all           |
| less than                  | `_lt`            | `<`                 | all           |
| less than or equal to      | `_lte`           | `<=`                | all           |
| greater than               | `_gt`            | `>`                 | all           |
| greater than or equal to   | `_gte`           | `>=`                | all           |
| like                       | `_like`          | `LIKE`              | `String`      |
| not like                   | `_nlike`         | `NOT LIKE`          | `String`      |
| case-insensitive like      | `_ilike`         | `ILIKE`             | `String`      |
| not case-insensitive like  | `_nilike`        | `NOT ILIKE`         | `String`      |
| similar                    | `_similar`       | `SIMILAR TO`        | `String`      |
| not similar                | `_nsimilar`      | `NOT SIMILAR TO`    | `String`      |
| regex                      | `_regex`         | `~`                 | `String`      |
| not regex                  | `_nregex`        | `!~`                | `String`      |
| case-insensitive regex     | `_iregex`        | `~`                 | `String`      |
| not case-insensitive regex | `_niregex`       | `!~`                | `String`      |

The `_not`, `_and`, and `_or` operators all work as usual.

## Mutations

Mutations are currently not supported by the connector.
